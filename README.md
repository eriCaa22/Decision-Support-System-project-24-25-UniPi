## LDS-project 

This repository holds the project for the course of Laboratory of Data Science, within the Decision Support Systems course.
You can find the final report in the file Group_ID_24_Report.pdf

Part 1

In Part 1 of the project, you are required to create and populate a database starting from different files and perform some operations on it. We also needed to solve some exercises using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) with computation on the client side (i.e., do not use any SQL command in the nodes, only standard SSIS nodes).

Part 2

In Part 2 of the project, you have to answer some business questions on a datacube you will create on the prepared database. Document how you build your datacube in your report and solve the business questions using MultiDimensional eXpressions (MDX) in SQL management studio. The last part was to realize some dashboard on PowerBI, this part is only present into the report.
